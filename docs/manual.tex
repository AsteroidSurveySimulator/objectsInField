\section{Introduction}

This software generates a list of candidate detections for an input
asteroid population and a list of telescope field pointings.

\section{Installation}

The software has been tested with Python 3 on MacOS and Linux.

Requirements:\\
- python 3\\
- spiceypy python library\\
- pyoorb python library\\
- other standard python libraries like numpy, pandas, etc.\\
- NAIF SPICE Utilities\\

Setup:\\
- Make sure you can import spiceypy, pyoorb, and other libraries in python.\\
- Make sure you can run the NAIF SPICE Utility executables from your command line.\\
- Download the package and run the DownloadKernels.sh script in the kernels/ folder.\\
- Copy the binary de430.dat file required by pyoorb into the data/ folder.\\

The directory structure is as follows:\\

\begin{forest}
  for tree={
    font=\ttfamily,
    grow'=0,
    child anchor=west,
    parent anchor=south,
    anchor=west,
    calign=first,
    edge path={
      \noexpand\path [draw, \forestoption{edge}]
      (!u.south west) +(7.5pt,0) |- node[fill,inner sep=1.25pt] {} (.child anchor)\forestoption{edge label};
    },
    before typesetting nodes={
      if n=1
        {insert before={[,phantom]}}
        {}
    },
    fit=band,
    before computing xy={l=15pt},
  }

    [\_\_init\_\_.py]
    [shared.py]
    [sso.py]

  ]
]
\end{forest}

An additional directory will be created to store trajectories of
asteroids as SPK files~\citep{spice}.


\section{Usage}

The software should be run from the main directory. The general usage
of the software is: \\

\verb+$ python main.py configfile > output+ \\
or \\
\verb+$ python main.py -f configfile > output+ \\

Here \verb+configfile+ is a file containing all the input parameters
for the simulation. The output can be redirected to a file using the
redirection operator, \verb+>+. By default, the software doesn't
overwrite existing asteroid SPK files unless you use the \verb+-f+
flag. A sample configfile named \verb+input.config+ is provided with
the package.

The descriptions of the various files needed by the software are given
in the subsections that follow.

\subsection{Configfile}

The `configfile' follows the structure used by the \emph{configparser}
module of \emph{Python}. A sample configfile named \verb+input.config+
is provided in the \verb+main+ directory. Briefly, the file is divided
into sections that begin with headers of the form \verb+[SECTION]+,
where \verb+SECTION+ is the name of the section. Each section consists
of multiple lines of the form \verb+keyword = value+.  The
\verb+configfile+ for this software consists of four sections. All
sections are mandatory but some keyword/value pairs are optional.
Table \ref{tab:desc} describes each keyword that the software
accepts. Mandatory fields are denoted by an asterisk (*).

\begin{longtable}{l l p{20mm} p{50mm}}

                                                               The software also uses this folder to write the temporary files.\\ \\

\end{longtable}


\subsection{Survey database}

The survey database is an LSST OpSim SQLite database or a reduced
version of it with only the necessary fields. At a minimum the database
requires the `ObsHistory' table with the fields described in Table
\ref{tab:sumdesc}.

\begin{longtable}{l l p{20mm} p{50mm}}
    \hline
    Column name                   & Type     & Units   & Description\\

                                                         as the angle between North on the sky and the "up" direction 
                                                         in the focal plane. \\ \\
\hline \\


\caption{Survey database `Summary' table.}
\label{tab:sumdesc}                                                                   
\end{longtable}


\subsection{Instrument field of view definition}
\label{sec:fov}
The instrument field of view (FOV) is defined in a plain text file
called the `camera file', which is input via the \verb+Camera+ keyword
in the \verb+configfile+. The first line of the camera file defines
the type of FOV. Currently allowed values are \verb+Circle+ or
\verb+Polygon+.  If the first line is \verb+Circle+, then the
following line is the radius of the circle in degrees. If the first
line is \verb+Polygon+, then the subsequent lines will be the angular
coordinates of the corners of the polygon in degrees.
Figure~\ref{fig:instrument} shows the coordinates for a rectangular
FOV. Each row in the file lists the coordinates of a single
corner. The corners are listed in either clockwise or
counter-clockwise order. For the instrument shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:instrument}, the camera file would be:\\\\

\verb+Polygon+ \\
\verb+x1 y1+ \\
\verb+x2 y2+ \\
\verb+x3 y3+ \\
\verb+x4 y4+ \\\\

The camera file for an instrument with a circular field of view with
half angle of 1.5 degrees would be:\\\\

\verb+Circle+\\
\verb+1.5+\\\\

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{InstrumentFOV}
  \caption{Coordinates of a rectangular field of view.}
  \label{fig:instrument}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Asteroid population model}
The Asteroid population model file is a plain text file containing a
table of orbital elements in the Ecliptic J2000 frame. The first line
of the file is the header describing the columns,  which can be
in any order. The suggested column names are as follows:

`OID' for Object ID,\\
`FORMAT' for format of elements. Suggested format is `COM' for cometary elements,\\
`q' for perihelion distance in au,\\
`e' for eccentricity,\\
`i' for inclination in degrees,\\
`node' for longitude of ascending node in degrees,\\
`argperi' for argument of pericenter in degrees,\\
`t\_p' for time of pericenter passage in MJD,\\
`t\_0' for epoch of the orbital elements in MJD,\\
`H' for absolute magnitude.\\

Value of OID should be unique for each object.
